TO DO:

-E add to the notes the decision i made, respect to checking of stock 
-M detect that text field for quantity is not working
-M feat show out of stock indication
-H refactor remove hard links to IDs in database
-E change the name of every Arr[0] to Arr['value'];


DONE:
-complete the db, add table for user, volunteer, and order items
-change position of + and - (ticket 3 days)
-check log in from HOME
-check registration from shopping cart and from HOME
-M refactor eliminate hardcoded code (timetable)
-H fix  shopping cart does not show the items (log in) 
        -fixed the db for the defined value
-M refactor repeated code (timetable)
-M make a shareable function for the showing the timetable
-E sort out text "Test profile" on payment screen (ask muskan)
-M refactor (ticket section is hardcoded), make function to generate ticket line
-M design UI for showing that an item has been added: replace alert by friendly overlay
-H implement (if needed) "item added" feature
-E fix  change position of + and - (for all ticket)
-E change old server name(http://hfitteam1.infhaarlem.nl/) to new server name
-M check if the hfitteam1 is wrong
        -suspect that it is only part of CMS that is why Dance is still working
-E DB.orders doesn't exist (new database)
-E check if the payment is fully working (see NOTES, for issues respect to shopping cart log in)
-H feat adapt stock in db 

NOTES:
-stock is not adapted and checked when adding an item to shopping cart
        no fix: code made by team mates, don't risk breaking their code
- Did not change old (wrong) references to hfitteam1, only for my own code
-it would have been better if there would be no temp order item table, so it is clearer with the design
- shopping cart is not 100% correct 
        scenario:
        not logged in - order - payment + login = ok (order is in temp_Order_item first, and then after logging in it goes to order_Items)
        not logged in - order - log in - shopping cart = no items shown (order remains in temp_Order_item)
        logged in - order - shopping cart - payment = ok (order goes to order_items immediately)
-orders table, order_Id is AI
